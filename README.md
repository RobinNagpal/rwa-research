# Audience
Our audience will be people who 
- have already been in crypto/blockchain for more than 6 months and know a bit about Real World Assets
- Any employees of the RWA blockchain companies
- Any one in the RWA company looking to hire us as consultants
- Any one looking to invest in RWA companies

# Objective
Based on the above we don't want to explain the very very basics of RWA. We want to explain     
- Blockchain is the natural fit for finance, but still its has not been adopted by the masses
- The RWA companies have not brought in real useful products for the masses
- There is no standardization in the legal setup and regulatory compliance for RWA companies is very difficult, but we 
at DoDAO make it very easy for new builders to understand


# Offerings
We will have the following four offerings:
- RWA research: We cover the most detailed research on RWA assets, laws, regulations, and use cases(This should have some link to take the user to https://research.chainedassets.com/)
- Landscape: We have covered the most comprehensive list of RWA companies and their products(This should have some link to take the user to https://landscape.chainedassets.com/). This needs to be developed.
- Consulting: We provide consulting services to RWA companies to help them with their legal setup, regulatory compliance, and product development
- Business Development: We help RWA companies find the best assets and partners for their business.
