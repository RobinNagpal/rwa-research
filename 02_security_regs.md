# Regulations and Compliance

- We are dealing with people's money, so we have to be very careful about how we handle it.
- In DeFi, people are more aware and they know that they are taking risks. But when it comes to RWAs, we can't rely on the same level of awareness in general population.
- Also the DeFi assets are purely onchain, making it easier for anyone to see the full picture.
- RWAs are offchain, not all the data is available, and minimal information is available onchain. 
- In Crypto we say don't trust, verify. The asset represented often cannot be 100% verified because of the technical limitations of the old systems that hold the true picture of the asset.
- In the bear market of late 2022 and 2023, many projects which had offchain components and didn't all the information
available onchain, or to the public, were not able to survive. One of the main reasons were that they were not keeping
customer's funds separately.
- Only a handful of projects which were help custody of user's assets were able to survive. And if we see these projects
like coinbase, Kraken etc, we see that they try to be as compliant as possible.


# Compliance for Startups
- Startups have limited resources and regulations and compliance needs effort and money. And mostly when working with RWAs, 
the cost of regulations can be as little as 100s of thousands of dollars to millions of dollars.
- So for a startup, it is important to focus on finding the right customer, the right usecase and the right product first.
- Once the product is validated, and we know that there is real demand for it, then we can start thinking about regulations and compliance.

# Regulations in US
- US is undoubtedly one of the most important markets because of the size of the market, the customer base and the amount of money that is available.
- But US is also one of the most regulated markets.
- So if we are offering RWAs on chain, you are offering securities, and you have to comply with the regulations.
- If you choose to just validate with a small group of users, you can be exempt from the regulations. US makes it easy
if you are purely focused on the accredited investors or professional investors. Then the effort to comply with the regulations is minimal.
- So you should focus on just part of the US maket first, or outside the US market.

# Global Regulations
- You have to comply with the regulations of the country where you have registered your securities and where you are offering them. Both of them.

# Exemptions in US
- We explained above that you can target only accredited investors and professional investors and you can be exempt from the regulations.
- There are other exemptions as well, like Reg A, Reg CF which allow you to raise money from the general public, but with some limitations.
